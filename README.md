R-code for th calculation of direct and indirect contact rates (per day) of 5 species in the Kruger National Park.
These files create contact matrixes that can be fed directly into SIR-type models, using contact rate as a part of the transmission parameter (transmission rate = contact x probability of transmission).
Data collected for these calculation was done by camera-traps, and can be found here: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3Aaa2e3a76-2a32-4acd-9e05-a8ac50fda40e.
